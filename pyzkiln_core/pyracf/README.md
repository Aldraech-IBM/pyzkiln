# pyracf
A Python interface to the library of services provided by RACF

The Python interface to RACF has been very successful, and grown into a larger 
project requiring a repository of its own.  The code previously contained here has been 
archived in ```pyracf_archive.tar.Z```.

Please see [https://github.com/ambitus/pyracf](https://github.com/ambitus/pyracf) for
the current implementation of pyracf.
