A place to create bricks that will build new structures on z/OS. 

People want to manage resources on z/OS like they manage resources on any other Cloud platform. To do this effectively,
we need to create capabilities that hide things like JCL and assembler macros from management tools. This effort is 
dedicated to creating be basic bricks that can be used to build those new capabilities on the platform.

Imagine managing resources without every writing JCL? Imagine automating management tasks using the same scripting tools
that are common on other platforms. Imagine using automation tools like Ansible to manage z/OS resources. This repository
will contain the collective python components from multiple businesses. Together we can build a new management infrastructure 
for z/OS.

The tools in this repository will rely on:
* IBM's Open entprise SDK for python: https://www.ibm.com/products/open-enterprise-python-zos
* IBM's Z Open Automation Utilities: https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSKFYE_1.1.0/welcome_zoautil.html

Consider contributing to this repository. Anyone interested in creating python building blocks for managing z/OS resources
is welcome to contribute.
